  "abstract": "Background and aim: Obstructive coronary disease is one of the most important causes of death worldwide. Percutaneous coronary intervention is one of the most important treatments of this pathology. Using of coronary artery stents represented a major advance in interventional cardiology. While bare metal stents (BMS) set the reference point for improved safety over balloon-angioplasty, first-generation  drug-eluting  stents  demonstrated  significant  improvements  in  efficacy,  but  not necessarily safety, and further technologic developments have focused on optimizing both. Methods: We studied 228 patients with STEMI in the last 6 months, divided in 2 groups – in the first group  are  122  patients  (53.5%)  who  developed  in  stent  restenosis  and  the  second  group  has  106 patients  had  no  signs  of  restenosis  (46.5%).  The  mean  time  of  performing  the  angiographic reevaluation was 111 days for the first group and 154 days for the second group. The clinical signs that indicate the need of coronary reevaluation was stable angina (116, 50.87%), acute coronary syndrome (58, 25.4%) and asymptomatic patients (64, 28.9%). The cardiovascular risk factors correlate with high risk  of  restenosis  was  diabetes  (24.3%  in  first  group  and  12.2%  in  the  second  one,  p=0.004),  active smoking (p=0.010) and metabolic syndrome (p=0.003). The stent’s length >28mm, stent’s diameter ≤ 2.5 mm and chronic occlusion correlate with high risk of in-stent restenosis in BMS. Conclusion: Understanding the importance of risk factors control, will reduce the risk of restenosis, of other cardiovascular event, even sudden death.",
