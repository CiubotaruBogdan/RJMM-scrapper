  "abstract": "Introduction: Tuberculosis (TB) is still one of the most frequent infectious diseases, causing 2 million deaths a year worldwide. The prevalence of TB has increased in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised and virtually, it can affect any organ. Up to 25% of tuberculosis cases present extra-pulmonary involvement. The diagnosis of extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB) is difficult, often requiring biopsy. Material and methods: We present two cases of EPTB in immunocompetent young women. The first case is about a 15-years old female who presented with persistent high fever, ascites and an increased CA-125 serum level. Biochemical analysis of ascites fluid revealed a high value of adenosine deaminase (ADA), negative Ziehl-Neelsen stain and undetectable Mycobacterium tuberculosis at PCR assay. The peritoneal biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of peritoneal TB. The second case, a 29-years old female with a seven-month history of cervical lymph nodes swelling, with drainage and excision biopsy performed, misdiagnosed  as  cats-scratch  disease  based  on  the  histological  description  as  granulomatous lymphadenitis,  which  turned  out  to  be  tuberculous  lymphadenitis  at  the  second  histopathological opinion. In  conclusion,  these  cases  highlight  the  need  for  tuberculosis  consideration  in  the differential  diagnosis  of  extra-pulmonary  involvement,  even  in  immunocompetent individuals, in order to decrease the misdiagnoses and complications rates.",
