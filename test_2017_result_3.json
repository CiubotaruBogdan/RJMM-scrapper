  "abstract": "Pathologists observed the presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in solid tumors many years before the research focus shifted from cancer cells to the tumoral microenvironment. In lung adenocarcinoma TILs vary in number, phenotype and distribution. Our study investigate the type and  distribution  of  TILs  regarding  the  stage  of  disease  and  histological  subtype  in  27  cases  of  lung adenocarcinoma. By immunohistochemistry we evaluated semi-quantitatively CD3, CD8 and cyclin D1. We have found that CD3+CD8- lymphocytes prevail at the invasive margin and in tumoral stroma. Cyclin D1 was diffusely positive in tumoral cells in all the five cases of lepidic type of lung adenocarcinoma. In other histological types cyclin D1 was focally positive, most at the margin of the tumor irrespective of the presence or absence of TILs.",
